# Traffic-Control-for-Ambulance
Smart Traffic Clearance System

The project is divided into 3 modules:
  a. Location, path detection and extraction for emergency vehicle
  b. Emergency vehicle detection
  c. Traffic signal response to the emergency signal received
  
> Location, path detection and extraction for emergency vehicle
  - Using NEO-6M GPS receiver module 
  
>Emergency vehicle detection
  - Yolo v4 architecture
  - Google colab (training & testing)
  - 87% accuracy!

>Traffic signal response to the emergency signal received

  Arduino controlled traffic signal 2 cases:
  - Normal mode
  - Blue mode(emergency)
  - Impulse here is given by switches, work as a response to stimuli given by ambulance detector
